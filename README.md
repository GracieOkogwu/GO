â€‹Hello!

Researching and creating content strategies, content calendars, and writing captions for social media posts are key components of my daily responsibilities as Content and Communications Manager.

I have provided my writing and communications services to customers in Africa, The United States of America, and Europe.

Between 2020 and 2022, I was part of the Content Team at Ultima Studios that ideated, developed, and executed a youth-centric radio station in Nigeria's commercial capital, Lagos 88.5UFM as well as 2 seasons of international business reality game show, Lions' Den (Shark Tank, US)

In the past year, I have been an active part of the global Communications Team as Deputy Team Lead, developing magazine, social media, and website content for the first-ever supply chain intelligence platform in Africa - Supply Chain Africa.



I would love the opportunity to further discuss how I can contribute to the success of your Content Team.

Thank you in advance for your consideration, as I look forward to hearing from you.
